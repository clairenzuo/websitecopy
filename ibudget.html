          <p>Research
I sent out an anonymous user survey with a few questions to learn more about the budgeting habits of post-secondary students. I received 52 responses, here were some questions that I asked: </p>

          <div class="moregrid">
            <img src="artwork2.jpg" alt="me"/>
            <p>Research Summary  
              The majority of users did not track their budgeting using any method due to it being too much of a hassle to calculate everything. 
              
              Common causes behind the lack of management in finances in post-secondary students?
              
              Not differentiating between wants and needs
              
              Pressure of frequenting social activities
              
              First experience managing personal expenses 
              
              Lack of money management knowledge
              
              Neglecting payments due to busy schedule or forgetfulness 
              
              Not keeping track of how much they have spent
              
              Underestimating the accumulation of small costs</p>
              <p>Competitor App Analysis
                When breaking down the users that use budgeting apps the main responses I received were: Personal bank app (“Chase”, “Bank of America”) , “Mint”, and “Buddy”. When analyzing them I found several main takeaways. 
                
                Good Features: Ability to see upcoming payments (all), previous transactions (all), notifications (Mint and Buddy), the ability to categorize (banking apps and Mint), Simple interface (Buddy). 
                
                Can be Improved: Separated by monthly, doesn’t allow a comprehensive overview (Buddy), Category labelling errors (banking apps and Mint), more focused on full-time workers with  features such as investing (Mint), inability to see how fees are calculated (all).</p>

                      I created two potential users and analyzed how their spending and budgeting habits would translate differently through iBudget based off of their personality.  Through their interactions we can see how the features on iBudget can be useful regardless of a student’s personal lifestyle.
