        <div class = "briefdescription">
          <p>I'm working as a UX Design intern @ blank previously <span class="civixtext" > @Civix </span>, and <span class="whylinetext">@Whyline</span>. I'm also currently an Information Science/HCI (UX Design Path) student <span class="umichtext">@UMich</span>. I live in New York and was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. 
            I’ve always loved traditional art, but have expanded my passion towards technology based design.</p>

          <img src="profile.jpg" alt="me!"/>
         <p>I’m currently an undergrad student at the University of Michigan. I live in New York City and was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. 
           <br>
           <br>
          I’ve always loved traditional art, but have expanded my passion towards technology based design. Studying interactions between users and their screens has become a great interest to me, and learning to apply the design theories and illustration techniques I’ve previously learned to user interaction has been really eye-opening. It allows me to be hands on in all stages of app designing process from creating screens to illustrating them to prototyping them!<br><br>
          Expanding my interests is one of the most important things to me, and I’m forever searching to learn new forms to express myself through. I often explore my creative pursuits through experimenting with a vast variety of different aspects of art and design. </p>

        <h2>Outside of work and class...</h2><br>
         <p> I love longboarding and skateboarding.</br>
          I wanted to start a new hobby during summer 2021 that I could do outside, so I started skateboarding. I've taught my friends 
          and am always looking for new tricks to learn. I now longboard to class everyday. 
        </p> 
          <p>I love movies! My first UX design was actually a movie tracking app called "Watchlist". My favorite genres are
            thrillers and dramas. Some of my favorite movies include Life of Pi, Black Swan, Shutter Island,
            Parasite, American Beauty, Gone Girl, and the Great Gatsby.
          </p>
          <p>I also love to read. I used to read for 30 minutes everyday and collected a lot of novels. Some of my favorites
            include Lolita, Jane Eyre, The Green Mile, Life of Pi and Gone Girl (book version), The Catcher in the Rye, The Bell Jar,
            Animal Farm, and The Handmaid's Tale.
